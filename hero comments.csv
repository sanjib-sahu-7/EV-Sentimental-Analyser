"I bought a Honda Optima because I was having delivery problems with my restaurant food and other items as well. Now that I am happy with its performance and efficiency, my customers also appreciate it. We are never late for any kind of purpose. My raw materials also came on time. At this date, I am using 7 Honda Optima, and all are quite effective. It has 250 watts of maximum power, 50 km of riding range, telescopic suspension on both sides, and a CB braking system with a drum, which is good for my workers.",0.3563186813186813

"The Okinawa Ridge invites you to explore an undiscovered home. This electric motor scooter may give a veritably ultrapractical and effective boost for beginners to the megacity. Its satiny and truly ultrapractical project draws concentration. Because to the thorough webbing processes, you may travel with confidence. It has a remarkable range and is aimed for long peregrinations through megacities. The main argument I like this model is its unanticipated capacity to give, which makes it an excellent volition for individualities appearing for an electric scooter that matches their brazen-facedattitude.The electric motor on the two- wheeler is in fantastic shape and has an emotional range. It also seems unanticipated.",0.4095238095238095

"I have been riding hero electric optima cx with dual battery in hyderabad since july, 2022 and here is my feedback: good: - two batteries, So you always have a backup - both batteries removable, So you can remove each battery separately and charge at home or anywhere.- two chargers provided that work for both batteries, So you can keep one at home and one in bike for emergencies.- low pricebad: - very low ground clearance, Bottom hits most of the speed breakers.- very slow on slopes.- slow on plain roads too with an adult pillion rider.- top speed of 45 kmph, Feels less on empty roads sometimes.- pathetic customer service and delivery experience.- not high quality materials used, Does not feel robust overall.",-0.03221088435374151

I bought an electric scooty eight months ago and I am extremely dissatisfied. Not only is the battery malfunctioning, but the tire has also developed a dangerous bubble. These issues, along with the previously mentioned wobbling, have made the ride uncomfortable and risky. To make matters worse, the customer service has been unresponsive and unhelpful. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product due to its unacceptable quality and lack of support. I will clime the battery warranty before two months but I'm still not received the battery. Please don't buying hero electric scooters.

The Hero Electric Flash was a great buy and a good option for students. The power is less than some other electric bikes, but it is a great choice for daily use and short-distance rides, especially in its price range. The maintenance and servicing of the bike is also quite simple, so even beginners can handle it easily. It is not the best option for long-distance rides, but it is great for short trips of up to 15 km.

After driving the Hero Electric Flash, I found the appearance looks good but the performance was very poor. The quality of the vehicle was not good, with the shock absorber failing after only two months. I found that it was very difficult to find a local shop to do puncture work or to dismantle and assemble the wheel. Connectors for the motor were also not easily accessible. After running it for only 5000 km, I found that the battery cost was much higher than that of a petrol vehicle. This purchase only brought me unhappiness and a lot of disadvantages. The service center was also very poor and no one seemed to care.

I bought the Hero Electric Flash in June 2019 for around 41,000. The bike looks great and the plastic body gives it a modern look. However, I would not recommend it to carry more than 130-150kg of weight as the speed can be affected. I have had a small accident while riding the bike and the plastic body was not able to handle the impact. The bike takes around 8-9 hours to charge and can last up to 30-45 km. When I first bought it, there was no footrest for keeping my legs but the company may have added that feature since then. The maintenance of the bike is not that difficult as all you need to do is charge it and keep it clean. I would recommend to take it in for servicing every 2-3 months as it might cause some break issues. Other than that, the Hero Electric Flash is an amazing ride and you will be feeling happy driving it.

I am really impressed with this electric scooter. It's been really reliable for my daily use, and I haven't had any issues with it so far. I usually drive around 70 kilometers a day, and it has never let me down. It's also quite low maintenance, so I don't have to worry about taking it in for repairs any time soon. I also enjoy taking it on long trips, and it has been able to handle 80 kilometers per day without any problem. I highly recommend this electric scooter for anyone looking for a reliable and low maintenance option.

The Hero Electric Photon is a great electric scooter that offers impressive performance. It's capable of reaching high speeds, and has plenty of torque for tackling city streets or highways. However, comfort is not the best when riding this scooter. The back seat lacks support, and the height might not be suitable for everyone. In addition, the side stand does not automatically go up when you're riding, which can cause the scooter to hit bumps and speed bumps. Overall, the Hero Electric Photon is an excellent electric scooter with great performance, but it could be improved in terms of comfort and convenience.

I am extremely disappointed with the service provided by Hero Electric. I purchased a Hero Electric Photon scooter three months ago and the charger has already gone out of order. It has now been almost a month and the company still has not replaced it. The customer service and the dealer service are both very poor. I feel like I have wasted my money and the company is not taking any responsibility for the issue.

It is expected that only short rides in the suburbs and occasionally around the city can be taken with a car with a maximum range of 65 to 80 km. This is mainly due to the relatively long charging time of 6 to 8 hours and the absence of a fast charge option for the bike and the infrastructure required for it. Owners must make their own arrangements for electrical outlets. This is fine if you are on a familiar route, but it creates a lot of uncertainty when in an unfamiliar location.

The scooter also contains electronic regulators with 12 mosfets and a 24MHz fast controller, which gives the drivetrain a prompt reaction and no flag misfortune. The AGM VRLA battery in the Photon is explicitly intended for the most noticeably awful climatic conditions in India.

Despite the limited power output, the main problem is that there is a lot of scope for improvement in the throttle tuning. Driving a scooter in city traffic is tough because even small amounts of throttle and carefully calculated openings lead to the scooter lurching forward sharply at low speeds. No matter how hard you try, the accelerator only has two possible settings: on and off.

Within six months of purchase, I had to replace the battery of my hero bike twice. This is unacceptable and I feel the company should take measures to ensure the battery lasts at least one to two years or 10,000 km, or 500 charging cycles. Furthermore, the plastic body of the bike does not offer enough strength for the price. To top it off, the company does not respond to phone calls or emails. This indicates that Hero is an extremely mismanaged organization.

I recently purchased an NYX E-5 and as happy to be able to save both the environment and money. However, after a few days, I have encountered several issues. Firstly, the seat lock was not working and I was unable to charge the battery because the charger was locked in the seat. I managed to open the seat and charge the battery. Upon visiting the workshop, the mechanic found some wires had burnt near the connector and he replaced it.The same issue occurred a few days later and a mechanic from the workshop was reluctant to come, but eventually agreed after I requested, and charged me Rs. 200 for the visit. When I arrived at the workshop, the engineer identified that the wire near the connector had burnt again and replaced it. Additionally, the charger socket was not functioning, which he changed. The entire visit took me 3 hours and I was very frustrated.Thankfully, when I went to the workshop on another occasion, two engineers from Hero Electric were already present and they assisted me in resolving the issue.

Company claims to provide 60km of running on 8 hours of charging, which is not true. The maximum distance you can ride is 45 km, and the distance will decrease when you use the headlight. Additionally, service and showroom points do not have permanent employees, which means if you have any problems with your vehicle, you may have to wait for at least three months before you can ride it again.

I'm in full agreement with everyone here that the scooter is a great alternative to bikes. It runs on electricity, is incredibly quiet, and has a comfortable seat for up to two people. It has an impressive range of 70kmpl per charge, which makes it great for those wanting to hone their riding skills or for everyday commuting. I highly recommend it!
