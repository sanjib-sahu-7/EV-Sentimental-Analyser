The Great Ola and The Bad	",0.0500000000000001
The great ola and the bad ola ola s1 pro is the topend model of s1 series.Pro means it have biggest battery and fastest motor in series.Its claimed range is 181 km.The pros:it have the most powerful motor in the segment.It have very good pickup.The 4kwh battery gives you assusrance of 100km(2 passengers/normal mode) or 125km(1 passengers/normal mode).That range is sufficient as an epectric scooter.Have great seat comfort means no issues for longer rides.Silent as hell.Many people like the sound their bike (vroom vroom) but it is very silent as it only motor and battery but they give you option to stimulate sound from speakers.The boot space is very good you can place two small size helmets easily.The display have good brightness you can see every details even in the sun.There are 4 modes in this ev scooter which lets you choose power or more kilometers.Its hyper mode is very powerful the scooter gets instant acceleration.The cons:it is very costly compared to any petrol bike or scooter the differnce in pricing will take about 35000km to 50000km or 3-4 years.You can't change modes if the system detects that you are using too much power.Normal mode will be stuck for the journey.It is not a reliable ev as it can broke down anytime without any reason.I myself faced this issue.Once you want to get it repaired you need to make a complaint to ola they will pickup your vehicle in 2-3 days and repair it in 2-3 days sometimes more.Basically once you compaint to repair it they will take about 1 week to fix your scooter and give it to you.Its build quality is pretty bad you can feel it on a bad road.Even in high speed winds you can feel that it is all plastic and can be blown away.The horn and indicator should have been like any other bike or scooters because their position is very illogical.Horn button specially is far from hand itself.The conclusion:it is a good ev but with lots of drawbacks.You may only buy it if you travel more than 60km daily only then its cost will be justified.Most of these issues are not only with this ev but all the ev but ola seriously need to work on it build quality and buttons.,0.1663562091503268

"Beware of ola electric scam on may 4th, The ola service center(998v+4wh, Bhagya nagar colony, Hydershakote, Telangana 500091) personnel took my brand new ola s1 pro(ts08dbtr7401, Order id: oet-646****403) by van, Claiming it had suffered a rodent attack and could only be repaired at their service center.On may 11th, I received a call requesting a payment of rs.6345.86 through online mode for the repair of the scooter.I made the payment as requested.They assured me that the scooter would be delivered by van to my location.However, Instead of delivering it by van, They rode it to my location, Which is approximately 35km away from the ola service center.As the owner of the scooter, I hadn't even ridden it yet as it was brand new.While inspecting the scooter in the presence of the ola service center delivery personnel, I noticed that the brand new ola s1 pro's side stand had been replaced with an old, Damaged one.When i brought this to the attention of mr.Cornelius lewis(ph #: 070320 87244), The manager of the ola service center, He behaved rudely and showed a complete lack of respect for customers.He told me to do whatever i could and that he didn't care.His behavior was reminiscent of that of a rowdy individual.We discovered the issue with the side stand because it was visible, But how are customers supposed to know if the internal parts, Which are not visible, Have also been replaced with old ones? i now feel like i have been scammed by the ola service center, As they replaced the brand new parts in my scooter with old ones.When i received the delivery of my brand new ola s1 pro, The odometer reading was 2.2 kilometers.However, When the ola service center personnel took the scooter for repair, The reading was 15 kilometers.And when they delivered the scooter from the ola service center, The reading was 55 kilometers.I now feel like i have been given a used, Second-hand ola scooter instead of a brand new one.",-0.0062200956937799095

Worst and pathetic. in first	",-0.5833333333333334
Worst and pathetic.In first month itself you will get to know that you have been scammed by ola owner.Goverment should investigate this matter.Such occurance will deter people from buying electric vehicle in future.We were 10 people who brought the scooter together and after 1 month 7 scooters are already stopped running and none of them are assisted by the ola support.Even after buying there special care plan you will get no call from them.Before you buy the scooter you will get so many calls and after you had your first break down no one will reach you.I urge people not to go with ola.The problem is not only about the product but the problem of not helping customers.One of the evidence is they had started sales office just for 2 months in airoli navi mumbai which they closed immediatly after the deliveries.As they were facing lot of customer issues.,0.012698412698412695

"When it works, it works well, but the trouble is that my personal Ola S1 Pro has been pretty troublesome in the four months I’ve had it. It’s conked twice and for a scooter with just 166km on the clock, it’s pretty unacceptable. Like a faithful pooch (dog lover Bhavish will agree with me on this one) the S1 Pro doesn’t like being left untouched and ignored for long spells. After returning from a week-long trip to Israel, I tried powering up the S1 Pro and absolutely nothing happened. The scooter was dead as a brick. I called the Ola helpline and within two hours, the service van arrived and whisked my scooter away. Apparently, the battery drained whilst I was away and the deep discharge damaged one of the cells. The scooter was returned in a couple of days with a beta version of the new Move OS 2.0 software.",0.0396694214876033
"I was told at the time that out of approximately 5,000 Ola owners in Mumbai, around 130 were given the software upgrade, so I should feel privileged. The improved software has some pretty smart features like navigation and Bluetooth pairing with my smartphone.",0.02142857142857142
"Fast forward to a month later and it’s the same story. I was in London and Europe for two weeks only to return to – you guessed it – a dead scooter. The Ola service van, now a familiar sight, came home in a couple of hours, but thankfully, my scooter didn’t have to be taken away and the technicians brought it back to life.",0.05357142857142857
"Finally, the long promised Move OS 2.0 was installed and I have to say I felt no real difference over the beta version which had worked just fine. I haven’t tried all the features yet and that will be the focus of my next long-term report.",0.05333333333333333
"As a daily commuter, the S1 Pro is just brilliant. It’s so easy to ride, slices through traffic (in hyper mode) and is pretty practical too. The luggage box under the seat is just huge and takes my laptop bag and a small duffel bag too. Not so big is the slot for the phone holder, which can’t take a large smartphone like my iPhone 13 Pro Max.",0.24345238095238098
"The truth is I haven’t ridden this scooter enough to draw a conclusion of what it’s like to live with over extended periods. My average running for the past four months is just 1.3km a day. The scooter still feels like new and, in fact, the service van must have clocked more to and fro mileage in tending to my scooter’s problems!",0.08295454545454545

"It was last year when Ola Electric revealed the Ola S1 and S1 Pro and in the months that followed, it became the most talked about electric scooter in India for a variety of reasons and continues to be so, even today. The Ola electric scooter did not have the best start to its innings in India. There were all sorts of controversies around the scooter, fire, breakdowns, glitches, instances of scooter going reverse at high speeds. But at the same time, it holds a lot of promise too! And why do we say that? You will see.",0.33199999999999996

All the functions of the scooter can be accessed via a 7-inch TFT touchscreen which is not the most responsive, but it works. Ola offers in-built navigation that is offered by MapMyIndia, then there's Bluetooth connectivity, which can be used to play music from your phone on to the speakers in the front apron. The sound output is not too bad either, but not what an audiophile would want. ",0.13333333333333336

"Other features include cruise control, a low-speed reversing mode and digital locking and unlocking for the scooter as well as the under-seat storage space. So, in short, there is no key needed at all, but that may raise safety concerns and in case your scooter is fully out of charge, you can still open the boot from your smartphone app! At three per cent charge, the scooter automatically goes into 'park' mode, which could be a cause for concern too. Of course, we haven't cut it that close with the scooter yet. The one issue that bugged us was that the under-seat storage space refused to open at the first go, while shooting, but a quick reboot and the functioning was back to normal. So, as it turns out, the Move OS 2.0 update is yet to squash all the bugs!",0.06458333333333333
