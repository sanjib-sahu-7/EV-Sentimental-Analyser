"Okinawa praise pro has power of the 1000w. The electric motor is capable enough to pull out the driving range of 88 km and the pricing is starting from 97 thousands which makes it in higher side as per the specs. The claimed range of electric scooter is the 88 kmph but in actual driving it pulls only 55 kmph. It ihas modern features like keyless start, anti theft sensor, find my scooter and side stand sensor. Its led headlamps attached with the DRLs looks very stylish and indicators are placed on the steering part of the scooter.",0.1625

"My family bought Okinawa about 7 months ago, and it gives perfect performance and an effective riding experience.

the Essence of Electric Riding.	",0.0
"It's a terrible experience to ride the Okinawa PraisePro. It covers a lot of ground, involving interpretation and responsibility. It has an incidental project that's visually charming. Strong movie procedures guarantee the quality of the Rider movie. Because it impeccably strikes a balance between effectiveness and administration, it's the swish option for regular outward transportation. This model has come one of my favorite faves because of the features it offers. For anyone who values a secure and point- rich electric motorscooter, it's a greatoption.This electric two- wheeler is a future- acquainted investment for me. It's tasteful and long- lasting. A engine whose value will boost with time.",0.20833333333333334

Comfortable and efficient ride	",0.4
"This scooter provides a level of comfort that is hard to match. In addition to the ride quality, the iPraise+ also offers impressive mileage, with a range of over 120km on a single charge. This makes it suitable for daily travel and eliminates concerns about running out of charge during your commute. With its modern design, contoured front end, and LED lights, the iPraise+ is not only comfortable but also stylish. It even comes with basic electronic features and riding aids to enhance the overall experience. Although the footboard may be high for taller riders, the overall comfort and performance of the Okinawa iPraise+ make it an excellent choice for those seeking a comfortable and efficient ride.",0.24668154761904762

Fineness and efficacity	",0.0
"In a demesne of electric versatility , the Okinava Commendation Master arises as an undercover peculiarity of style and extravagance . Its feel consistently robe the progressive designing inside. The engine's ability murmurs promises of flurry, all while the battery's seeing imperativeness ensures odysseys untamed. Regenerative artfulness and natural intuitiveness embellish the experience. However, monetary contemplations warrant notice. Not with remaining, for specialists ofeco-accommodating transport, the Okinava Recognition Master coordinates an unmatched orchestra of fineness and efficacity, getting away the unremarkable with a quiet yet vibrant ability.",0.12916666666666665

I bought this scooter 2 years ago. It was a lead acid version. I complained about this scooter so many times but the dealer's don't listen to you after you've purchased their product. I feel that I could have got second hand petrol Vehicle just by the transportation cost I paid on this useless scooter to complaint to the dealer . ,-0.12
"i purchased the okinava praise the moment it was launched  only because i like to help  in whatever little way to save the environment.I own electric car revai, i use solar lighting  and also solar water heating.
Anyway i paid through my nose for the praise 86500 and in just two months the controller failed.Then a month later  the mcb failed and they have replaced the mcb twice.The servicing of the scooter takes a minimum 5 to 6 days.The hooter alarm  has failed and they have permanently disconnected it as they are fed up of listening to complaints and that too within a year.
Now the scooter is one point five years and the front shock absorbers have failed  in fact they had failed within one year but they could not get spare parts from the company and  i had to wait till now and now i have to pay .The rear brakes have failed they say and have gone rusty and they have to replace the entire assembly.They have  raised a bill of 5600 rupees  and can you imagine this  amount for a one point five year old scooter repairs/servicing.",-0.18068181818181817
